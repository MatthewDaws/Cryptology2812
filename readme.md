# MA2812

This is a collection of simple Number Theory / Cryptographic routines to support my lecturing of "MA2812 Cryptology" at [UCLan](https://www.uclan.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/mathematics-bsc).

## Installation

To use `pip` and install the mainline version directly from GitHub, run

> pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Cryptology2812/zipball/master

You can also clone the repository, and then in a local copy run

> python -m build

> pip install dist/ma2812-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

The first of these commands uses the [`build`](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package to build a wheel, and then the second command uses `pip` to install the wheel.  The build instructions are in `pyproject.toml`.

## Usage

Coming soon.  Students enrolled on MA2812 can find a full guide on Blackboard.
